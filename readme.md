# Future Enhancements

 - Improve UI: The current design of the website can be improved by making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. This can be done by using a modern design framework like Bootstrap 4, Materialize or Foundation.
 
- Refactor HTTP codes sent with responses from the server: The website can be made more robust by using the correct HTTP status codes with the responses sent from the server. This can improve the user experience by providing clear and accurate feedback to the user.

- Migration from Bootstrap 3 to the latest: The website can be made more modern by migrating from Bootstrap 3 to the latest version of Bootstrap. This can bring in new features, bug fixes and performance improvements.

- Migration from CodeIgniter 3 to latest: The website can be made more secure and reliable by migrating to the latest version of CodeIgniter. This can also improve performance and bring new features. It is important to check whether restserver would work with later versions of CodeIgniter before migrating.

- Fetch data on each page using Backbone.js: The website can be made more dynamic and efficient by fetching data on each page using Backbone.js. This can improve the user experience by making the website more responsive and reducing the amount of data sent to the client.

- Data validation using Backbone.js: The website can be made more secure by validating data on the client-side using Backbone.js. This can prevent malicious data from being sent to the server and improve the user experience by providing clear and accurate feedback to the user.

- A workaround to not send header and footer with each view: The code can be made more DRY by not having the statements to load header and footer with each view.

- Refactor URLs or use Routing: The website can be made more user-friendly and easy to navigate by refactoring the URLs or using routing. This can improve the website's SEO and make it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
